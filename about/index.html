        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Tavolo Solutions LLC was founded in 2018 by our Founder and CEO Sana Shah. The name Tavolo comes from the italian word for <b>table</b>. Tables are open workspaces that foster collaboration, which is the way we want to work with our clients, by building something great where everyone has a seat at the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Tavolo we value open communication, inclusivity, integrity, optimism, and passion for design and our clients.
